Santa Clause had been doing his job for a long time now, but he had never seen such a child concerned so much about his family.
Such a pathetic list of items a child can want like:-
1.) Increase the salary of my papa so that he can buy the objects of his own interests....
2.) Please give my mother a weekly holiday like every other person of the world....
3.) Please give me enough power so that I can tackle with the people who bully my sister in her school....
